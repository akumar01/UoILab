Notes

- No parallelization support (code blocks conditioned on self.comm are ignored)

- Since we are using matlab builtin functions rather than sklearn classes, the 
implementation of code involving selection_lm and estimation_lm are slightly 
different. In particular, the predict method is written into each particular
linear model class 

- uoi_selection_sweep left unimplemented since it doesn't seem to be in use

- wrote our own train_test_split function as there is no built in equivalent
 in Matlab

 - wrote our own _preprocess_data function as there is no built in equivalent
 in Matlab

 - Using an estimation score class

 - need to implement set_interept, check X_y
