Notes

- No parallelization support (code blocks conditioned on self.comm are ignored)

- Since we are using matlab builtin functions rather than sklearn classes, the 
implementation of code involving selection_lm and estimation_lm are slightly 
different. In particular, the predict method is written into each particular
linear model class 

- uoi_selection_sweep left unimplemented since it doesn't seem to be in use

- wrote our own train_test_split function as there is no built in equivalent
 in Matlab

 - wrote our own _preprocess_data function as there is no built in equivalent
 in Matlab

 - Using an estimation score class

 - need to implement set_interept, check X_y

- Need to finish writing ESF score functions 
- Make sure to check for 0 vs. 1 indexing problems
- Be careful about element-wise operations
- Immediate to-do: look at UoI_Lasso get_reg_params --> need to implement
preprocess_data and check_Xy

02/17/2019
- Finish intersection and then start testing

03/14/2019
- Started debugging - current error in using vecnorm command (was only 
added in 2017)

03/17/2019
- Currently cannot include initialization arguments in arbitrary order
- Need to make our own train_test_split (currently using dividerand) to 
permit use of stratify flag
- Matlab lasso does not support abstol or maxiter keywords

03/29/2019
- changed addOptional to addParameter to allow arbitrary order of arguments
- dividerand supports number of targets - probably sufficient for stratification
03/30/2019
- Continue transferring tests to matlab

04/14/2019
- Stepping through run_tests_lasso
- Since all inputParser arguments must be processed in UoI Lasso, need to pack
- them up into a varagin-like cell to pass onto the base classes (in progress of
- implementing)

06/07/2019
- There is no stratify functionality in train_test_split 

06/08/2019
Alpha grid is not working identically to sklearn. Need to step through the 
code more carefully
